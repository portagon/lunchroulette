## About

This is a small app to mix and match collegues for a break to get to know various people within the organitzation.

The goal is to strengthen the Work@portagon even further.

So, anybody can sign up for a specific day. Then you get randomly matched to 3 colleagues to have a break. To avoid the endless discussions about where to have the perfect meal, the designated restaurant gets supplied to the group.

### Corona Update
As we cannot meet each other over a break in person, it is now changed to a (virtual) break. Let's stay together in these times :smile:
